    Motifs: connected subgraph enumeration
========================================================================

Motifs is a fast and scalable algorithm for counting frequency of 
connected induced subgraphs in a network. The program counts the number 
of occurences of a every possible connected subgraph on K nodes in a 
given graph. Frequency of such network motifs can be used to compare and
characterize networks.

The algorithm is described in Efficient Detection of Network Motifs by 
Sebastian Wernicke. IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and 
Bioinformatics, 2006.

For information about network motifs refer to Network motifs: Simple 
building blocks of complex networks by R. Milo, S. Shen-Orr, S. Itzkovitz, 
N. Kashtan, D. Chklovskii and U. Alon. Science, October 2002.

The code works under Windows with Visual Studio or Cygwin with GCC,
Mac OS X, Linux and other Unix variants with GCC. Make sure that a
C++ compiler is installed on the system. Visual Studio project files
and makefiles are provided. For makefiles, compile the code with
"make all".
